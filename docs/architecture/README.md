# Outfitter Architecture

## Purpose

Outfitter is a TypeScript CLI that resolves, composes, bakes, and launches agent configuration stored in the [Dotagents `.agents` protocol](https://dotagentsprotocol.com/) (pinned at revision `502a9d5`).
It is generic enough for organizations to define resources once and run them across multiple agent CLIs, while supporting `pi` first and most deeply, plus Claude Code as an additional supported adapter.

Outfitter's differentiated value is source resolution, selective composition, task baking, validation, provenance, and harness projection — not ownership of a configuration format.
The protocol tree is the source of truth and remains useful without Outfitter.

Formal implementation requirements live in [`../requirements/`](../requirements/); note the [transition status](../requirements/README.md) — this document describes the RFC [#165](https://github.com/ai-outfitter/outfitter/issues/165) target architecture.

## Architectural Principles

1. **TypeScript first**: production code, tests, schemas, and tooling are centered on TypeScript.
2. **Protocol-native storage**: all authored configuration is a protocol `.agents` payload.
   Outfitter-specific metadata (settings, provenance) is optional, namespaced, and removable without losing the underlying resources.
   No parallel manifest, persona, or task YAML formats.
3. **Pin the protocol**: the implementation and its conformance fixtures target one pinned protocol revision.
   Protocol upgrades are deliberate, reviewed changes — never silent tracking of upstream `main`.
4. **One resolver**: listing, validation, task baking, running, and dumping share a single effective-resolution path.
   There is no code path that composes resources differently from another.
5. **Deterministic composition**: identical sources, refs, selections, and inputs produce identical results — the same effective identity for a run, and byte-identical output for a dump.
6. **Generic composition, adapter projection**: compositions are harness-neutral; adapters project them to agent-specific files, flags, and environment variables.
   If a composition asks for something an adapter cannot project, Outfitter warns to stderr; `--strict` makes it fatal.
7. **Pi-native by design**: pi is not merely the first adapter — targeting pi natively and completely is a deliberate design choice.
   Pi's configuration surface (extensions, plugins, subagents, keybindings, bootstrap) is treated as first-class, and the composition model is validated against it before being generalized to other harnesses.
   Claude Code and Codex CLI are supported additional adapters with documented gaps, not co-equal design targets; Codex currently projects only model and MCP servers.
8. **Command objects for complexity**: non-trivial CLI commands are implemented as command objects with explicit dependencies and typed inputs/outputs.
9. **Schema validation at boundaries**: every persisted file format read by Outfitter is validated at the read boundary (JSON Schema for JSON and YAML files, frontmatter schemas for markdown resources).
10. **Complete test coverage early**: the project maintains a test framework with a 100% global coverage requirement.
11. **Complexity limits early**: ESLint is configured with maximum complexity `10`.

## Runtime and Tooling Baseline

- Runtime: Node.js `>=24.18.0 <25`, tested with the exact version pinned in `.node-version`.
- Language: TypeScript.
  Package manager: npm.
- CLI framework: Commander `^14` (default commands, aliases, `allowUnknownOption`, pass-through argument collection, testable parser construction).
- Test framework: Vitest `^4` with `@vitest/coverage-v8`; 100% global coverage thresholds.
- Linting: ESLint `^10`, `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `complexity: ["error", 10]`.
- Schema and validation: TypeBox for schema authoring, JSON Schema artifacts for persisted contracts, AJV for runtime validation.
- YAML (`yaml`) for Outfitter settings; JSON for protocol files (`mcp.json`, `models.json`, `config.json`) per the protocol.
- Merge behavior: `defu` for settings; protocol merge-by-ID and JSON merge semantics implemented per the pinned revision with conformance fixtures.
- Process launch: `cross-spawn`.
  Discovery and URI parsing: `glob`, `hosted-git-info`.
  Diagnostics: `chalk`.
  Templating of generated harness files: `liquidjs` with Outfitter-specific delimiters.

The CLI workspace includes `code/cli/tsconfig.json` for strict typechecking and `code/cli/tsconfig.build.json` for production emission from `code/cli/src/` to `code/cli/dist/`.

## Repository File Structure

The repository layout and source/test directory boundaries live in [`./file_structure.md`](./file_structure.md).

## Onboarding

Pi-native first-run onboarding, `.agents` detection, and the `~/.claude` porting flow live in [`./onboarding.md`](./onboarding.md).

## Resource Model

Outfitter resolves protocol resources from layered `.agents` trees:

```text
~/.agents/                 # global layer
  agents.md
  system-prompt.md
  mcp.json
  models.json
  agents/<id>/agent.md     # + optional config.json
  skills/<id>/...
  tasks/<id>/task.md
  knowledge/...
  commands/...
  settings.yml             # Outfitter settings (namespaced, optional)
  settings.local.yml       # gitignored machine-local overrides
  cache/                   # synced remote sources (Outfitter-owned)

<project>/.agents/         # workspace overlay: same shape, minus cache
  settings.yml
  settings.local.yml
```

Remote sources (catalog repositories) supply additional layers below the local ones, in configured order.
A standalone catalog repository's root _is_ the payload; a colocated source nests it under `.agents/` (selected with the source's `path:`).

### Resolution semantics

- Resources merge **by ID** across layers: workspace over global over remote sources in configured order.
  The winning definition replaces lower ones; there is no partial merge of markdown resources.
- When the workspace and global payload roots canonicalize to the same on-disk directory (the working directory is home, or either path symlinks to the other), discovery collapses them into one global layer so identical slugs cannot self-shadow between 'workspace' and 'global'.
- After layer resolution, an agent's `inherits` graph resolves through that same effective set.
  Traversal is recursive parent-first, multiple parents retain authored order, diamond ancestors contribute once, and cycles or missing parents fail with their chain.
- Inherited selections retain the declaring agent and winning layer.
  This provenance is required for parent-local skills, per-agent configuration, and catalog prompt files to resolve against their owner rather than the selected child.
- JSON files (`mcp.json`, `models.json`, per-agent `config.json`) follow the protocol's JSON merge behavior across layers.
- The resolver produces one immutable **effective resource set** per invocation: every slug mapped to its winning source, with shadowed definitions retained for diagnostics.
- `list`, `validate`, `run`, and `dump` all consume the same effective resource set.
  This is a hard invariant, enforced by sharing one `Resolver` component.
- Conformance fixtures (layer trees + expected effective output) pin the merge semantics to the protocol revision; a protocol upgrade updates fixtures in the same change.

## Settings

Outfitter settings are the only Outfitter-specific files in a tree: `settings.yml` plus a flat sibling `settings.local.yml` at both scopes.
There is no nested local settings directory.

### Precedence

Highest to lowest:

1. `<project>/.agents/settings.local.yml`
2. `<project>/.agents/settings.yml`
3. `~/.agents/settings.local.yml`
4. `~/.agents/settings.yml`
5. Cached remote settings referenced by `remote_settings`
6. Built-in defaults

The internal `Settings` object is the single conceptual result of reading all settings sources and applying precedence.
Every settings file MUST validate against `settings.schema.json`.

### Schema

```yaml
default_agent: engineer # which agent runs by default
default_harness: pi # which harness to launch: pi, claude, or codex
cache_directory: ./cache

sources:
  - github: ai-outfitter/community-profiles
    ref: <commit-sha>
  - github: example/payments-service
    ref: v1.2.0
    path: .agents
  - uri: git+https://git.example.com/team/agents.git
    ref: main
  - path: ../shared-agents

remote_settings:
  - github: example/.outfitter
    ref: <commit-sha>
    path: .agents/settings.yml

state_persistence: {}
custom_settings: {}
```

Rules:

- Settings do not carry resource selections.
  An agent's loadout — skills, subagents, mcp, extensions, plugins, model, thinking, tools — is declared on the agent (`agents/<id>/agent.md` frontmatter or `config.json`), not in settings.
  There is no `profiles` map and no `default_profile`.
- `default_agent` names the agent plain `outfitter` runs; `default_harness` selects the harness (`pi`, `claude`, or `codex`).
- `sources` entries MUST specify a local `path`, a remote `uri`, or a `github` shorthand; remote entries accept `ref` and payload-subdirectory `path`.
  Relative `path` values resolve relative to the settings file containing them.
- `remote_settings` entries point at settings-style YAML files inside synced remote repositories; fetched by `outfitter sync` and loaded at lower precedence.
- `cache_directory` selects the repository cache root for sync, remote-settings loading, remote layer discovery, and default-catalog bootstrap.
  Its default is `~/.agents/cache`.
- `custom_settings` may contain arbitrary YAML-compatible nested data, deep-merged by precedence.

## Composition

For a selected agent, the composer builds the run's effective configuration from the effective resource set:

1. **Identity**: the nearest inherited `system_prompt` declaration (or tree root `system-prompt.md`) is the base; root `agents.md` follows; inherited/child `append_system_prompt` fragments and inherited/child agent bodies append parent-first.
   Each fragment carries source, owner, layer, and trust provenance.
2. **Prompt trust**: `{ file }` reads required trusted catalog content inside the declaring agent's winning layer.
   `{ repo_file }` reads optional untrusted active-repository content inside the project root.
   Both are checked after symlink resolution; named prompt slugs are not part of this contract.
3. **Subagents**: agents named in the selected agent's `subagents` loadout are marked for projection into the harness's delegation surface; their own selected skills are resolved and materialized separately from the leader's active skills.
4. **Skills**: skills named in the loadout are materialized (frontmatter `references`/`scripts`/`assets` resolved from their two-root model, validated for escapes and collisions) into generated skill directories.
5. **Harness elements**: extensions and plugins named in the loadout are marked for the adapter (first-class for pi).
6. **Structured configuration**: `models.json`, `mcp.json`, and per-agent `config.json` merge per protocol JSON semantics; the loadout's `model`, `thinking`, and `tools` select and constrain within them. A `provider/model` selection resolves once into a harness-neutral model target (dialect, endpoint, credential-variable reference, headers, capabilities, and provenance); adapters translate that target to native controls without changing its endpoint.

The composed result is a harness-neutral **composition plan** — the input to dump and adapter projection.

> **Tasks and bake** — freezing a named work contract and its typed inputs into an immutable execution artifact — are the subject of a [separate upcoming RFC](../documentation/tasks.md) and are not part of this architecture yet.
> The `ai-outfitter/actions` Action currently launches a composed agent headlessly with structured inputs through the same resolver.

## Dump

`outfitter dump` writes the effective resource set (or one selection's transitive closure) as a plain `.agents/` directory.
The removable `.agents/.outfitter/composition.json` audit record lists each composed agent's resolved inheritance chain and ordered prompt provenance without prompt contents or absolute paths.

- Deterministic: byte-identical for identical inputs.
- Safe: never contains credentials, auth state, sessions, transcripts, caches, backups, mutable harness state, or symlinks resolving outside the tree.
  Dump shares the state-path knowledge of the adapters to guarantee exclusion.
- Protocol-shaped: valid payload for any protocol consumer; Outfitter provenance metadata is optional and removable.

## Generated-File Templating

Generated harness files may use LiquidJS templating with Outfitter-specific delimiters (`[[= expression ]]`, `[[% tag %]]`) so templates do not collide with agent prompt, skill, Handlebars, Mustache, Jinja, or Claude Code syntaxes.
Plain `[[ -f file ]]` shell text passes through unchanged.
The template context exposes resolved `custom_settings`, settings, the composition, the agent id, and the project root.
Undefined output variables and unknown filters are template errors; undefined variables in conditions evaluate falsy.
Source files are never rewritten; templating applies only to generated composition files.

## Runtime Model and State

A launch materializes the composed agent under the system temp directory:

```text
$TMPDIR/outfitter-<agent>-<harness>-<random>/
```

Adapter-declared state paths symlink to durable native CLI locations (`~/.pi/agent/...`, `~/.claude/...`) per the functional state model — see [`./state_writeback_strategy.md`](./state_writeback_strategy.md).
State handling strategies are `symlink`, `discard`, `warn`, `error`, and `prompt`; unknown writes are never silently persisted.
`state_persistence` policy lives in settings.

The Pi adapter reconciles generated runtime `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` (reserving `Shift+Tab` for Outfitter mode switching) as non-durable generated files.
Interactive Pi launches inject the Outfitter bootstrap extension for build/plan mode switching; non-interactive launches skip it.
After projection and bootstrap attachment, Outfitter reads root-owned [system extension hooks](../documentation/hooks.md#system-extension-hooks) and prepends their Pi extensions to every launch plan, including non-interactive and RPC launches. This post-projection boundary keeps the hook out of `.agents` layers, settings, composition, loadout support checks, and `--strict` handling. It is launcher-scope default injection rather than managed enforcement; the hook source is stamped into the child environment so downstream evidence can identify system-path versus session-provided configuration.

During `outfitter run`, the Outfitter process remains alive while the child agent CLI runs and owns the temporary composition lifecycle.

## Agent Adapter Boundary

Each supported CLI has an `AgentAdapter` implementation that projects a composition plan to native configuration:

```ts
interface AgentAdapter {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly supportedElements: readonly string[];
  readonly statePaths?: Readonly<Record<string, StatePathDeclaration>>;
  createProjection(
    composition: CompositionPlan,
    input: {
      readonly rootDirectory: string;
      readonly homeDirectory?: string;
      readonly cacheDirectory?: string;
      readonly settings?: Settings;
      readonly projectDirectory?: string;
    },
  ): AgentProjectionPlan;
  createLaunchPlan(projection: AgentProjection, passThroughArgs?: readonly string[]): AgentLaunchPlan;
  getUnsupportedElements(composition: CompositionPlan): readonly string[];
}
```

The adapter owns CLI-specific details: env vars, flags, state path declarations, warnings, and unsupported elements.

### Pi

Pi is the default adapter.
Outfitter prefers native pi mechanisms: `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`/`--session-dir`, `--extension`, `--skill`, `--prompt-template`, `--system-prompt`/`--append-system-prompt`, model/provider/thinking flags, and generated settings reconciliation where flags are not the right mechanism.
Startup-order-impossible requests surface as adapter warnings (`--strict` makes them fatal).
Because the projection root is removed after the run, launches default `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` to pi's durable per-project session folder (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<encoded cwd>--`) so sessions outlive the projection and stay shared with a standalone pi; an inherited `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` is left in place, and pass-through `--session-dir`/`--no-session` still win by pi's own precedence.
If generic naming conflicts with pi behavior, prefer pi's terminology.

### Claude Code

Outfitter launches `claude` over the user's own Claude configuration by default, passing the projection root through `--plugin-dir`, and maps the elements supported by the current baseline adapter to native files and flags. An isolated run (`--isolated`) points `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at the projection root instead, making the composition the whole configuration.
Managed harness links are opt-in through `outfitter link`, which places skills, generated agent definitions, commands, `CLAUDE.md`, and user-scope MCP servers into the Claude home under an ownership manifest (the persistent projection [#187](https://github.com/ai-outfitter/outfitter/issues/187) deferred); setup does not create them.

### Codex CLI

Outfitter launches `codex`, maps model selection to `-m`, and injects selected MCP servers through repeated TOML-valued `-c mcp_servers.<id>.<key>=...` overrides. The overrides merge with Codex user and project configuration because Codex has no way to run with only the projected MCP servers, so every launch warns that lower-layer servers remain active, including when the composition selects no servers. Codex cannot project the composition identity and reports it unsupported on every launch, so `--strict` aborts every Codex launch. Pass `exec` through to select Codex's non-interactive subcommand; without it, the normal interactive CLI launches. Other loadout elements remain unsupported and use the normal warning mechanism.

## CLI Commands

- **`outfitter run [agent]`** (default command): resolve → compose → project → launch.
  A positional agent slug selects what to run (default from settings `default_agent`); `--harness <pi|claude|codex>` selects the harness (default from settings `default_harness`, then `pi`); unknown args pass through to the child CLI; `--strict` makes warnings fatal.
  Interactive clean-home launches start Pi-native onboarding; non-interactive clean-home launches require `outfitter setup` first.
- **`outfitter setup [source]`**: launch the bundled, offline Pi walkthrough: one profile screen (featured default-catalog profiles, a More-profiles row, and an import-another-catalog row), original target wording, and optional direct-source path; append only the default CLI-agent choice (Pi/Outfitter preselected) and, for Pi with no provider connected, an in-session `/login` step; then atomically apply the result through the CLI state machine.
- **`outfitter sync`**: validate local settings; atomically fetch configured remote settings; reload the merged settings; then atomically fetch every resulting remote source into `<cache_directory>/repos/<encoded-uri-and-ref>/` and record its verified commit under `<cache_directory>/source-state/`.
  Validate before swapping, preserve the last good checkout on failure, report per-source status, and redact embedded credentials from all output. Required-source failures exit nonzero.
- **`outfitter run`**: enforce the selected source-cache policy before resolution. Healthy manifest-backed caches stay network-free; repair mode atomically rebuilds unhealthy remote caches, locked mode requires full commit pins, and offline mode fails closed without network access. Explicit local paths are never cache-managed.
- **`outfitter sources`**: report local, direct, remote-settings, and transitive source precedence plus credential-redacted cache health and revisions.
- **`outfitter list [kind]`**: report the effective resource set — slugs, winning sources, shadowed definitions — deterministically.
- **`outfitter validate [--strict] [--json]`**: protocol layout, frontmatter and JSON schemas, unresolved loadout slugs, skill reference escapes/collisions, settings schema.
- **`outfitter dump [--agent <id>] [--out]`**: write the deterministic tree, optionally restricted to one agent's transitive closure.

> `outfitter task bake` is deferred to the [tasks RFC](../documentation/tasks.md).

## Command Object Pattern

Each non-trivial command is a command object with explicit dependencies (`SettingsLoader`, `Resolver`, `Composer`, `Baker`, `ProcessRunner`) and typed inputs/outputs — no direct `process.argv` access inside command logic.
Benefits: unit testability, low parser coupling, explicit dependencies, natural complexity limits.

## Validation Strategy

Validation happens at every file boundary: settings (`settings.schema.json`), protocol JSON files (schemas per the pinned revision), resource frontmatter, task input contracts, command inputs, and cache metadata.
Diagnostics point to the file and key that failed where practical.

## Test Strategy

- Global coverage threshold: 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- **Protocol conformance fixtures**: layered `.agents` trees with expected effective resolution output, pinned to the protocol revision.
- Deterministic tests for settings precedence, task input validation, bake determinism (content-hash stability), dump byte-identity and hygiene (no credentials/state), cache path encoding, generated launch env/argv, and unsupported elements with `--strict`.
- Scenario fixtures for common combinations instead of one-off bespoke setup; conventions in [`./file_structure.md`](./file_structure.md).

## Settled Decisions

1. npm with committed `package-lock.json`; Commander; Vitest with V8 coverage.
2. Resource IDs are filesystem-safe slugs; display names live in frontmatter.
3. The protocol revision is pinned; upgrades are explicit, fixture-backed changes.
4. There is no legacy profile compatibility layer: no readers, writers, aliases, detection, or migration commands.
   The only old-version material is the manual migration reference routed from the bundled Outfitter skill.
5. A remote repository named `.outfitter` is supported only as a distribution convention for the new protocol payload.
6. Claude Code and Codex CLI are supported as additional adapters; Codex currently projects only model and MCP servers, and pi remains the default.
