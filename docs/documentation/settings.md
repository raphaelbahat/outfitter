# Settings

Outfitter settings configure how resources are resolved and launched. They live inside the `.agents` tree so a tree carries everything it needs, and they are the only Outfitter-specific files in it — deleting them leaves a pure protocol payload.

Settings do not carry an agent's resource selections. An agent's loadout — its skills, subagents, model, and so on — lives on the [agent](./agents.md). Settings separately record which workflow roots are explicitly enabled.

## Scopes

| Scope         | File                                                       | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project-local | `<project>/.agents/settings.local.yml`                     | Personal, uncommitted overrides for one machine. Gitignore it. |
| Project       | `<project>/.agents/settings.yml`                           | Committed settings shared by everyone on the project.          |
| User          | `~/.agents/settings.yml` (+ optional `settings.local.yml`) | Personal defaults across projects.                             |
| Remote        | Cached files from `remote_settings`                        | Organization-distributed defaults.                             |

`settings.local.yml` is a flat file beside `settings.yml` — there is no nested local directory. It overlays its sibling with the same schema and higher precedence, and is the natural home for machine-specific values such as absolute paths to local checkouts (see [Local development](./local-development.md)).

In a standalone `.agents` repository the repository root is the tree, so the files are simply `settings.yml` and `settings.local.yml` at the root.

**Path resolution.** Every settings key that names a filesystem path (`cache_directory`, a
`sources` `path:`, `agent_defaults.pi_overlay`, `pi_binary_path`) follows one rule: a leading
`~` or `~/` expands to your home directory (a `~name/` form is left untouched), an absolute
path is used as-is, and any other relative path resolves against the settings file that declared
it.

- `default_agent` / `default_harness` — which agent plain `outfitter` runs, and the harness it launches in.
- `isolation` — whether a run stands on the harness configuration already on this machine. `inherit`, the default, layers the composition over it, so a Claude run keeps your workspace trust, permissions, credentials, plugins, and MCP servers. `isolated` launches from the composition alone, which is what a reproducible CI or container run wants; `--isolated` selects it for one run. Only Claude has an inherit path today. This key is honored **only** from your own `~/.agents` settings: a checked-in project or a remote catalog must not decide how much of your machine a profile it ships can see.
- `sources` — ordered list of remote or local `.agents` payloads. Remote entries (`github:` / `uri:`) accept `ref:` pinning and an optional `path:` to the payload inside the repository; see [Catalogs](./catalogs.md) for conventions and trust guidance.
- `workflows` — unique workflow root slugs enabled by this file. The effective set is the ordered, deduplicated union from every loaded remote, user, user-local, project, and project-local settings file. Missing and empty lists enable no roots. Source catalogs contribute definitions, but their settings are not loaded. `outfitter list workflows` shows enabled roots only; `outfitter validate` fails when an enabled root is not resolvable or its reachable workflow, agent, and resource closure is invalid; and `outfitter dump --workflow <slug>` requires the root itself to be enabled. Nested workflow dependencies are enabled implicitly for an enabled root's closure, but cannot be dumped directly unless separately listed. Normal resource precedence applies, so a project workflow definition overrides the same slug from the user or a catalog.
- `remote_settings` — shared settings a repository distributes; cached locally and merged below your project and user settings, so anything you set locally wins.
- `cache_directory` — the repository cache root used consistently by sync, remote settings, remote
  source resolution, and default-catalog setup. It defaults to `~/.agents/cache`; repositories live
- `pi_binary` / `pi_binary_path` — which pi binary pi-harness launches use; see [Pi binary selection](#pi-binary-selection) below.
- `source_cache.policy` — verifies remote caches before `run`: `repair` reuses healthy caches and
  atomically repairs unhealthy ones, `locked` also requires full commit pins, and `offline` never
  accesses the network.
  below its `repos/` directory.
- `telemetry.enabled` — the primary and sole persistent control for pseudonymous product analytics. Edit it directly to enable or disable telemetry. See [Telemetry](./telemetry.md) for consent precedence, automatic identifier cleanup, the event contract, and the current inert-build status.
- `agent_defaults` — additive loadout entries composed into **every** agent ahead of its own loadout; see [Agent defaults](#agent-defaults) below. It also carries `pi_overlay`, the runtime-file delivery control, and `extension_configs`, the file-based extension configuration surface; see [Pi runtime-file overlay](#pi-runtime-file-overlay) and [Extension configuration files](#extension-configuration-files).
- `harness_defaults` — native Pi, Claude Code, or Codex settings applied to every run of that harness; see [Harness defaults](#harness-defaults) below.

## Precedence

Higher wins:

1. `<project>/.agents/settings.local.yml`
2. `<project>/.agents/settings.yml`
3. `~/.agents/settings.local.yml`
4. `~/.agents/settings.yml`
5. Cached remote settings (in configured order)
6. Built-in defaults

Scalar settings override. `sources` follows last-wins ordering per scope so a higher-precedence file replaces the complete lower-precedence list. `workflows` and `agent_defaults` are additive ordered-set unions. `harness_defaults` and `agent_defaults.extension_configs` deep-merge with higher-precedence leaves replacing lower-precedence leaves.

## Agent defaults

`agent_defaults` composes one set of additive loadout entries into every agent — local runs, Actions, and dumps alike — so an organization declares a shared extension, skill, MCP server, plugin, delegate, or appended prompt fragment once instead of duplicating it into every `agents/<id>/agent.md`:

```yaml
agent_defaults:
  extensions:
    - git:github.com/ai-outfitter/pensieve@4b1e0d2c9a7f35e86b0d1c4a92f6e3d5a8b7c601
  skills:
    - organization-practices
  mcp:
    - github
  plugins:
    - org-plugin
  subagents:
    - org-reviewer
  append_system_prompt:
    - file: prompts/organization.md # resolved like agent prompt sources: catalog `file`, active-project `repo_file`
```

Composition rules:

- Defaults compose **before** each agent's own loadout — like a root-most ancestor ahead of the whole inheritance chain — using the same deterministic parent-first ordering and stable de-duplication as inherited agent loadouts. An agent that lists the same slug itself never duplicates it, and the settings layer wins first-encounter conflicts.
- Selections resolve catalog-wide across layers, never through an agent's local namespace.
- Only the additive loadout fields above are supported. Per-agent controls such as `model`, `thinking`, and `tools` stay agent-owned; `agents.md` remains shared prompt context, not a configuration manifest.
- `outfitter run`, `outfitter dump`, and `outfitter validate` compose the same effective defaults. Unresolved references are validation findings and composition warnings named `agent_defaults …`, and `outfitter dump` records the settings-layer provenance in `.outfitter/composition.json` plus a `settings.yml` carrying the merged defaults, so a dumped tree stays self-contained.
- Settings without `agent_defaults` behave exactly as before. The block is backend-neutral: no backend-specific keys, endpoints, or credentials.

## Pi runtime-file overlay

`agent_defaults.pi_overlay` points at a directory of runtime files — for example a pi-subagents definition and a file-based extension configuration:

```text
.agents/
├── settings.yml # declares agent_defaults.pi_overlay: pi-defaults/
└── pi-defaults/
    ├── agents/general-purpose.md # pi-subagents agent definition, fleet-wide
    ├── extensions/dynamic-context-pruning.json # extension configuration file
    └── settings.json # any other native agent-directory file
```

The contents are overlaid into **every** Pi runtime projection — including standalone agents that inherit nothing and own no per-agent overlay — so a fleet declares its runtime files once instead of copying them into every agent's `pi/` folder. The value is a directory path, resolved relative to the settings file that declares it; every settings scope may declare one, and they compose from lowest to highest precedence, with a higher layer's file replacing a lower layer's same-named file. One composition exception: when a lower layer delivered the same-named `*.json` file and both documents are JSON objects, they deep-merge instead — the higher layer's values win on conflicting keys, arrays are replaced wholesale by the higher layer — while every other file keeps whole-file replacement; a higher layer's file that is not valid JSON replaces the lower file whole and warns (fatal under `--strict`).

Runtime precedence is most specific first: an agent's own `pi/` overlay beats the settings layer, which beats generated defaults such as harness defaults and Outfitter's runtime settings. The delivery is file-based and non-durable — files land in the temporary projection root and are discarded after the run — and Outfitter never follows symlinks from the overlay. One delegation exception, shared with the per-agent overlay: a `agents/<slug>.md` file colliding with a declared delegate is replaced by the delegate, because a declared `subagents:` selection is an explicit choice. Settings-layer agent definitions are never tracked by the rebuild manifest, so they survive every delegate rebuild.

Keep secrets out of the overlay: the directory is copied verbatim into the runtime projection, so credentials belong in the environment or a credential store, not in overlay files.

Only the Pi adapter projects the overlay. Claude Code and Codex report it as an unsupported control — fatal under `--strict` — instead of silently dropping it, as does a declared directory that is missing, is not a directory, or is a symlink. `outfitter dump` warns that a configured overlay is not carried into the dumped tree.

## Extension configuration files

Extensions read configuration in two shapes, and `agent_defaults` covers both:

- **Settings-key configs** — native `settings.json` keys an extension owns (for example a compaction policy key). Declare them under `harness_defaults.pi` and they pass through to every projected runtime, standalone agents included. See [Harness defaults](#harness-defaults).
- **File-based configs** — `extensions/<name>.json` files an extension reads from the agent directory (for example `extensions/dynamic-context-pruning.json`). Declare them under `agent_defaults.extension_configs`:

  ```yaml
  agent_defaults:
    extension_configs:
      dynamic-context-pruning: # becomes extensions/dynamic-context-pruning.json
        rejectedSummaryMode: reject
  ```

Each map entry is materialized into **every** Pi runtime projection — standalone agents that inherit nothing included, whether or not the composed agent selects the extension (an unloaded extension ignores its config file).
Keys name the config file, so they accept file-name characters only (`A-Za-z0-9_-`); values are the extension's own config objects, which Outfitter passes through unvalidated.
Layers deep-merge per extension name, lowest to highest precedence, with a higher layer's values replacing a lower layer's.

The generated files are the lowest runtime-file tier: an agent's own `pi/` overlay, then the settings-layer `pi_overlay`, replaces a same-named `extensions/<name>.json` wholesale.
Like the overlay, delivery is non-durable — the files live in the temporary projection root and are discarded after the run — and `outfitter dump` warns that configured configs are not carried into the dumped tree.
Claude Code and Codex report a configured `extension_configs` map as an unsupported control, fatal under `--strict`.

Keep secrets out of config files: they are written verbatim into the runtime projection, so credentials belong in the environment or a credential store.

## Harness defaults

`harness_defaults` keeps organization- or project-wide native coding-harness policy beside the portable agent catalog without putting harness-specific keys in every agent profile:

```yaml
harness_defaults:
  pi:
    httpIdleTimeoutMs: 3600000
  claude:
    includeCoAuthoredBy: false
  codex:
    features:
      apps: false
```

The keys below each harness are passed through as that harness's native settings. `outfitter run` merges Pi and Claude defaults into its temporary `settings.json`; a Pi profile's own configuration overlay remains higher precedence. Codex receives flattened `--config key=TOML` arguments. `outfitter link` manages the same values individually in Pi or Claude `settings.json` and Codex `config.toml`, leaving every unrelated native setting untouched. An unmanaged value is never adopted or overwritten.

Every loaded settings scope may contribute defaults. Objects deep-merge from low to high precedence, while arrays and scalar leaves replace. `outfitter dump` carries the effective block into the dumped tree. Unknown harness names are rejected; supported names are `pi`, `claude`, and `codex`.

## Pi binary selection

Outfitter launches the bundled `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` by default, so every run gets the pi version Outfitter tests against. Two settings keys opt into a different binary:

```yaml
pi_binary: bundled # bundled (default), path, or auto
pi_binary_path: ./vendor/pi/pi # explicit binary for path mode; relative to this settings file
```

- `bundled` (the default) resolves pi from Outfitter's own dependency closure and launches it through the current Node runtime. If bundled resolution ever fails, the launch falls back to a PATH `pi`.
- `path` launches your pi: `pi_binary_path` when configured, else the `pi` on your `PATH` (a missing PATH pi produces the usual install guidance).
- `auto` tries the bundled pi first and falls back to the PATH `pi` when bundled resolution fails, warning about the fallback. `--strict` makes that warning fatal.

A `pi_binary_path` set without `pi_binary` implies `path` mode; setting it alongside `bundled` or `auto` warns that it is ignored. Relative paths resolve against the settings file that declares them, so a team can pin a vendored binary in the repository; a leading `~` expands to your home directory (see **Path resolution** above).

The `OUTFITTER_PI_BIN` environment variable overrides both keys for one run: set it to the binary path to launch (an empty value is ignored). A configured binary that does not exist on disk — via settings or the environment variable — fails the run before launch with an actionable error instead of silently reverting to the bundled pi.

Two boundaries do not change with the selection: a user-selected binary does not get `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` injected, so pi's own update notice stays visible for a binary you can actually update with `pi update`; and pi extension cache installs always use the bundled binary, so cache-time behavior stays pinned to the version Outfitter ships.
